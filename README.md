## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

This project is a great example of building a modern, full-featured web app with production-ready architecture:

✅ Scalable filtering logic  
✅ API integrations (Pexels)  
✅ Accessible and responsive UI  
✅ Follows current best practices with server/client component balance
